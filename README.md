*Project Report: Snake Game using SDL2 in C++*

*Internship Title*: Game Development â€“ Snake Game using SDL2

---

### *1. Project Overview*

This project involves the development of a classic Snake Game using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library in C++. The game was built as part of a game development internship program offered by CodTech. The primary focus was to implement a visually engaging and functional version of Snake with increasing difficulty levels and interactive user experience.

---

### *2. Objective*

* To build a simple, playable Snake Game using the SDL2 library in C++.
* To implement basic game mechanics: snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.
* To apply structured programming concepts for game development.
* To introduce increasing difficulty by accelerating the snake's speed as the game progresses.

---

### *3. Technologies Used*

* *Programming Language*: C++
* *Library*: SDL2
* *IDE*: Code::Blocks 25.03
* *Compiler*: MinGW (GCC)

---

### *4. Game Features*

* Basic snake movement with arrow keys.
* Random food spawning using the standard random library.
* Score tracking (printed in console).
* Increasing game difficulty with reduced time delay after each food capture.
* Game Over condition when snake hits wall or itself.

---

### *5. How to Play*

* Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
* Eat the red square (food) to grow longer and increase your score.
* Avoid hitting the boundaries of the window or the snake's own body.
* The game ends when a collision is detected.

---

### *6. Setup Instructions*

1. Download and install SDL2 library from [https://libsdl.org](https://libsdl.org).
2. Configure SDL2 in Code::Blocks by setting include and lib directories.
3. Link with -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2.
4. Copy SDL2.dll into your project folder.
5. Build and run the main.cpp code.

---


### *7. Conclusion*

The Snake Game project demonstrates foundational game development skills using SDL2 in C++. The game functions efficiently, with smooth controls, clear visual feedback, and a simple yet fun gameplay experience. The project also showcases basic understanding of SDL graphics rendering, input handling, and game loops.

---

### *8. Future Enhancements*

* Add sound effects using SDL\_mixer.
* Display the score within the game window.
* Add pause/restart functionality.
* Create a start menu or UI.
